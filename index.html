              <h3>What is Java?</h3>
              <p style="padding: 0 10vmin 0 10vmin;">Java is an object-oriented, cross platform, multi-purpose programming language produced by Sun Microsystems. 
                First released in 1995, it was developed to be a machine independent web technology. 
                It was based on C and C++ syntax to make it easy for programmers from those communities to learn. 
                Since then, it has earned a prominent place in the world of computer programming.</p>

              <h3>What is OOPs in Java?</h3>
              <p style="padding: 0 10vmin 0 10vmin;">
                  OOP concepts in Java are the main ideas behind Java’s Object Oriented Programming. 
                  They are an abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. 
                  Grasping them is key to understanding how Java works. 
                  Basically, Java OOP concepts let us create working methods and variables, then re-use all or part of them without compromising security.
              </p>
            </section>
            <section id="sec3"> <!--section 3-->
              <h3>What is the basic?</h3>
              <p style="padding: 0 10vmin 0 10vmin;">Every java program needs atleast one class which may have any name except the names like int, long, double, float, char, etc. 
                These are all data types, also known as keywords, about which you will learn in this tutorial. 
                The naming must not be done with the names of keywords and default class names of any package applied within a program.</p>
            </section>
            <section id="sec4"> <!--section 4-->
              <h3>Why should i learn Java?</h3>
              <p style="padding: 0 10vmin 0 10vmin;">The reason, which made Java popular is that it's an Object Oriented Programming language. 
                Developing OOP application is much easier, and it also helps to keep system modular, flexible and extensible.
                One more reason for Java programming language's huge success is it's Rich API and most importantly it's highly 
                visible because come with Java installation.Java provides API for I/O, networking, utilities, XML parsing, database connection, 
                and almost everything. Whatever left is covered by open source libraries like Apache Commons, Google Guava, Jackson, Gson, Apache POI, and others.</p>

            Java is a general-purpose computer-programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented, 
            and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers 
            "write once, run anywhere" (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation. 
            Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of computer architecture. 
            As of 2016, Java is one of the most popular programming languages in use, particularly for client-server web applications, 
            with a reported 9 million developers. Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems 
            (which has since been acquired by Oracle Corporation) and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. 
            The language derives much of its original features from SmallTalk, with a syntax similar to C and C++, but it has fewer low-level facilities 
            than either of them.</p>

            The original and reference implementation Java compilers, virtual machines, and class libraries were originally released 
            by Sun under proprietary licenses. As of May 2007, in compliance with the specifications of the Java Community Process, Sun relicensed most of 
            its Java technologies under the GNU General Public License. Others have also developed alternative implementations of these Sun technologies, 
            such as the GNU Compiler for Java (bytecode compiler), GNU Classpath (standard libraries), and IcedTea-Web (browser plugin for applets).<br><br>
            The latest version is Java 11, released on September 25, 2018. Java 11 is a currently supported long-term support (LTS) version 
            ("Oracle Customers will receive Oracle Premier Support"); Oracle released for the "legacy" Java 8 LTS the last "public update", 
            which is free for commercial use, in January 2019. Oracle will still support Java 8 with public updates for personal use up to at least December 2020. 
            Oracle (and others) "highly recommend that you uninstall older versions of Java",[23] because of serious risks due to unresolved security issues. 
            Since Java 9 is no longer supported, Oracle advises its users to "immediately transition" to Java 11. Oracle extended support for Java 6 ended in December 2018.<br><br>

            James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton initiated the Java language project in June 1991. 
            Java was originally designed for interactive television, but it was too advanced for the digital cable television industry at the time. 
            The language was initially called Oak after an oak tree that stood outside Gosling's office. Later the project went by the name Green and was 
            finally renamed Java, from Java coffee. Gosling designed Java with a C/C++-style syntax that system and application programmers would find familiar.<br>

            Sun Microsystems released the first public implementation as Java 1.0 in 1996. 
            It promised "Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA), providing no-cost run-times on popular platforms. 
            Fairly secure and featuring configurable security, it allowed network- and file-access restrictions. 
            Major web browsers soon incorporated the ability to run Java applets within web pages, and Java quickly became popular. 
            The Java 1.0 compiler was re-written in Java by Arthur van Hoff to comply strictly with the Java 1.0 language specification. 
            With the advent of Java 2 (released initially as J2SE 1.2 in December 1998 – 1999), new versions had multiple configurations 
            built for different types of platforms. J2EE included technologies and APIs for enterprise applications typically run in server environments, 
            while J2ME featured APIs optimized for mobile applications. The desktop version was renamed J2SE. In 2006, for marketing purposes, 
            Sun renamed new J2 versions as Java EE, Java ME, and Java SE, respectively.<br><br>
            In 1997, Sun Microsystems approached the ISO/IEC JTC 1 standards body and later the Ecma International to formalize Java, 
            but it soon withdrew from the process. Java remains a de facto standard, controlled through the Java Community Process. 
            At one time, Sun made most of its Java implementations available without charge, despite their proprietary software status. 
            Sun generated revenue from Java through the selling of licenses for specialized products such as the Java Enterprise System.<br><br>
            On November 13, 2006, Sun released much of its Java virtual machine (JVM) as free and open-source software, (FOSS), under the terms of the 
            GNU General Public License (GPL). On May 8, 2007, Sun finished the process, making all of its JVM's core code available under free software/open-source 
            distribution terms, aside from a small portion of code to which Sun did not hold the copyright.<br><br>
            Sun's vice-president Rich Green said that Sun's ideal role with regard to Java was as an "evangelist". 
            Following Oracle Corporation's acquisition of Sun Micro-systems in 2009–10, Oracle has described itself as the "steward of Java technology with a 
            relentless commitment to fostering a community of participation and transparency". This did not prevent Oracle from filing a lawsuit against 
            Google shortly after that for using Java inside the Android SDK (see Google section below). Java software runs on everything from laptops to data 
            centers, game consoles to scientific supercomputers. On April 2, 2010, James Gosling resigned from Oracle.<br><br>
            In January 2016, Oracle announced that Java run-time environments based on JDK 9 will discontinue the browser plugin.
